# SpaceWar Clone

Rough copy of an 80s game.


## To Run
`trunk serve` to run.

## Keybindings:

Arrow keys control, and numeric-0 to fire for the player-1.

z, c, and s, keys to control, and space to fire, for player-2.
(These are the mappings for the Dvorak keyboard layout, eventually I will map config change that.)

For single-player and network, the mouse will be orientation control.
